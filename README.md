  Protect GatsbyJS with Auth0 for Single Page Apps
</h1>

Often, you need to create an app with gated content, restricted to only authenticated users. Fortunately, with the new Auth0 Single Page App SDK and the GatsbyJS framework, you can add serious security to your app with minimal effort.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-auth0/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Open the `gatsby-auth0` directory in your code editor of choice and edit any file. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
